# NIRF-Ranking-predictor
The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The parameters broadly cover “Teaching, Learning and Resources,” “Research and Professional Practices,” “Graduation Outcomes,” “Outreach and Inclusivity,” and “Perception”.
<br>
From 2017, the main ranking parameters remain the same. So, for our predictions, we have taken data from 2017, 2018 and 2019.
<br><br>
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
The project seeks to predict what ranking a university could have gotten in 2020, based on the scores it received in five categories that were mentioned before. The scores for each category are out of 100. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Technologies used</b>
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS for styling of frontend and UI/UX.</li>
<li>Flask in order to handle backend.</li>
<li>Jupyter notebooks were used during the development of the model, with Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn and Matplotlib libraries.</li>
<li>The model was saved in pickle file and used in the web app via Flask.</li>
